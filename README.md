# A-hypothesis-regarding-Steel-tariffs-and-construction-sectors

U.S. President Donald Trump is proposing many tariffs against the country’s closest trading partners. As of writing, his proposed ad valorem tax of 25% on all aluminium and steel imports is due to take effect from 12th of March 2025. 
The primary focus of this piece will be on Trump’s steel tariffs, given that steel is a crucial component of construction sectors globally, but note that there are also proposals for other critical construction materials such as copper.
